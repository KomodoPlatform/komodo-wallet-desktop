The block time of the traded assets depends on each network (Bitcoin typically being the slowest) Additionally, the user can customize security preferences. For example,  (you can ask %1 to consider a KMD transaction as final after just 3 confirmations which makes the swap time shorter compared to waiting for a <a href="https://komodoplatform.com/security-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow/">notarization</a>.').arg(API.app_name)

                title: qsTr("Do I need to be online for the duration of the swap?")
                text: qsTr("Yes. You must remain connected to the internet and have your app running to successfully complete each atomic swap (very short breaks in connectivity are usually fine). Otherwise, there is risk of trade cancellation if you are a maker, and risk of loss of funds if you are a taker.
The atomic swap protocol requires both participants to stay online and monitor the involved blockchains for the process to stay atomic.
If you go offline, so will your orders, and any that are in progress will fail, leading to potential loss of trade / transaction fees, and a wait for the swap to timeout and issue a refund. It may also negatively affect your wallet's reputation score for future trade matching.
When you come back online, your orders will begin to broadcast again at the price you set before you went offline. If there has been significant price movement in the meantime, you might unintentionally offer someone a bargain!
For this reason, we recommend cancelling orders before closing %1, or reviewing and revising your prices when restarting %1.").arg(API.app_name)

1. %1 charges approximately 0.13% (1/777 of trading volume but not lower than 0.0001) as the trading fee for taker orders, and maker orders have zero fees.
2. Both makers and takers will need to pay normal network fees to the involved blockchains when making atomic swap transactions.
